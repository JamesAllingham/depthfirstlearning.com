<h1 id="why">Why</h1>

<p>TRPO is a scalable algorithm for optimizing policies in reinforcement learning by
gradient descent. Model-free algorithms such as policy gradient methods do not
require access to a model of the environment and often enjoy better
practical stability. Consequently, while straightforward to apply to new
problems, they have trouble scaling to large, nonlinear policies. TRPO couples
insights from reinforcement learning and optimization theory to develop an
algorithm which, under certain assumptions, provides guarantees for monotonic
improvement. It is now commonly used as a strong baseline when developing new
algorithms.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="1-policy-gradient">1 Policy Gradient</h1>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: Policy gradient methods (e.g. TRPO) are a class
  of algorithms that allow us to directly optimize the parameters of a policy by
  gradient descent. In this section, we formalize the notion of Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
  action and state spaces, and on-policy vs off-policy approaches. This leads to the
  REINFORCE algorithm, the simplest instantiation of the policy gradient method.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>At its core, REINFORCE computes an
    approximate gradient of the reward with respect to the parameters. Why
    can’t we just use the familiar stochastic gradient descent?
    <details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>
    Just as in reinforcement learning, when we use stochastic gradient descent, we also compute an estimate of the gradient, which looks something like $$\nabla_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)} [ f_{\theta}(x) ] = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)} [\nabla_{\theta} f_{\theta}(x)]$$ where we move the gradient into the expectation (an operation made precise by the <a href=""> Leibniz integral rule</a>). In other words, the objective we're trying to take the gradient of is indeed differentiable with respect to the inputs. In reinforcement learning, our objective is non-differentiable -- we actually <b>select</b> an action and act on it. To convince yourself that this isn't something we can differentiate through, write out explicitly the full expansion of the training objective for policy gradient before we move the gradient into the expectation. Is sampling an action really non-differentiable? (spoiler: yes, but we can work around it in various ways, such as using REINFORCE or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144">other methods</a>).
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>Does the REINFORCE gradient estimator resemble maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)?
    Why or why not?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
The term \( \log \pi (a | s) \) should look like a very familiar tool in
statistical learning: the likelihood function! When we think of what happens
when we do MLE, we are trying to maximize the likelihood of \( \log p(D | \theta) \)
or as in supervised learning, we try to maximize $$\log p(y_i^* | x_i, \theta).$$
Normally, because we have the true label \( y_i^* \), this paradigm aligns
perfectly with what we are ultimately trying to do with MLE. However, this
naive strategy of maximizing the likelihood \( \pi(a | s) \) won't work in
reinforcement learning, because we do not have a label for the correct action
to be taken at a given time step (if we did, we should just do supervised
learning!). If we tried doing this, we would find that we would simply
maximize the probability of every action; make sure you convince yourself
this to be true. Instead, the only (imperfect) evidence we have of good or
bad actions is the reward we receive at that time step. Thus, a reasonable
thing to do seems like scaling the log-likelihood by how good or bad the
action by the reward. Thus, we would then maximize $$r(a, s) \log \pi (a | s).$$
Look familiar? This is just the REINFORCE term in our
expectation: $$ \mathbb{E}_{s,a} [ \nabla r(a, s) \log \pi (a | s) ] $$
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>In its original formulation, REINFORCE is an on-policy algorithm. Why?
    Can we make REINFORCE work off-policy as well?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
    We can tell that REINFORCE is on-policy by looking at the expectation a bit
    closer: $$ \mathbb{E}_{s,a} [ \nabla \log \pi (a | s) r(a, s). ]$$ When we
    see any expectation in an equation, we should always ask what exactly is the
    expectation <b>over</b>? In this case, if we expand the expectation, we
    have: $$\mathbb{E}_{s \sim p_{\theta}(s), a \sim \pi_{\theta}(a|s)}
    [ \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta} (a | s) r(a, s), ]$$ and we see that
    while the states are being sampled from the empirical state visitation
    distribution induced by the current policy, and the actions \( a \) are
    coming directly from the current policy. Because we learn from the current
    policy, and not some arbitrary policy, REINFORCE is an on-policy. To change
    REINFORCE to use data, we simply change the sampling distribution to some
    other policy \( \pi_{\beta} \) and use importance sampling to correct for
    this disparity. For more details, see
    <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1079&amp;context=cs_faculty_pubs">a classic paper</a>

<h1 id="2-variance-reduction-and-advantage-estimate">2 Variance Reduction and Advantage Estimate</h1>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: One major shortcoming of policy gradient methods is that the
  simplest instantation of REINFORCE suffers from high variance in the gradients
  it computes. This results from the fact that rewards are sparse, we only visit a finite
  set of states, and that we only take one action at each state rather than try all actions.
  In order to properly scale our methods to harder problems, we need to reduce this variance.
  In this section, we study common tools for reducing variance for REINFORCE. These include
  a causality result, baselines, and advantages. Note that the TRPO paper does not introduce
  new methods for variance reduction, but we cover it here for complete understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the intuition for using advantages instead of rewards as the
    learning signal? Note on terminology: the learning signal is the factor by
    which we multiply <script type="math/tex">\log \pi (a | s)</script> inside the expectation in REINFORCE.</li>
  <li>What are some assumptions we make by using baselines as a variance
    reduction method?</li>
  <li>What are other methods of variance reduction?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
Check out the optional reading <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~owen/mc/Ch-var-basic.pdf">Monte Carlo theory, methods, and examples by Art B. Owen; Chapter 8</a> if you're interested! Broadly speaking, other techniques for doing variance reduction for Monte Carlo integration include stratified sampling, antithetic sampling, common random variables, conditioning.
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>The theory of control variates tells us that our control variate should
    be correlated with the quantity we are trying to lower the variance of.
    Can we construct a better control variate that is even more correlated
    than a learned state-dependent value function? Why or why not?
    <details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>
Right now, the typical control variate \( b(s) \) depends only on the state. Can we also have the control variate depend on the action? What extra work do we have to do to make sure this is okay? Check <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02247">this paper</a> if you're interested in one way to extend this, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10031">this paper</a> if you're interested in why adding dependence on more than just the state can be tricky and hard to implement in practice.
</p>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>We use control variates as a method to reduce variance in our gradient
    estimate. Why don’t we use these for supervised learning problems such as
    classification? Are we implicitly using them?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
 Reducing variance in our gradient estimates seems like an important thing
 to do, but we don't often see explicit variance reduction methods when we
 do supervised learning. However, there is a line of work around
 <b>stochastic variance reduced gradient</b> descent called
 <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf">SVRG</a>
 that tries to construct gradient estimators with reduced variance. See
 <a href="http://ranger.uta.edu/~heng/CSE6389_15_slides/SGD2.pdf">these
 slides</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6258">these</a>
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1873">papers</a> for more on this topic.
</p>
<p>
The reason that we don't often see these being used in the supervised
learning setting is because we're not necessarily looking to reduce the variance
of SGD and smoothly converge to a minima. This is
because we're actually interested in looking for minima that have low
<b>generalization error</b> and don't want to overfit to solutions with very
small training error. In fact, we often rely on the noise introduced by
using minibatches in SGD to help us to escape premature minima.
On the other hand, in reinforcement learning, the variance of our gradient
estimates is so high that it's often the foremost problem.
</p>
 <p>
 Beyond supervised learning, control variates are used often in Monte Carlo
 integration, which is ubiquitous throughout Bayesian methods. They are also
 used for problems in hard attention, discrete latent random variables, and
 general stochastic computation graphs.

<h1 id="3-fisher-information-matrix-and-natural-gradient-descent">3 Fisher Information Matrix and Natural Gradient Descent</h1>
<p><img src="/assets/fisher-steepest.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: While gradient descent is able to solve many optimization problems,
  it suffers from a basic problem - performance is dependent on the model’s parameterization.
  Natural gradient descent, on the other hand, is invariant to model parameterization.
  This is achieved by multiplying gradient vectors by the inverse of the Fisher
  information matrix, which is a measure of how much model predictions change with
  local parameter changes.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Consider classifiers <script type="math/tex">p(y | x; \theta_{1})</script> and <script type="math/tex">p(y | x; \theta_{2})</script>,
such that <script type="math/tex">l_2(\theta_1, \theta_2)</script> is large, where <script type="math/tex">l_2</script> indicates the
Euclidean distance metric. Does this imply the difference in accuracy of the
classifiers is high?
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
The accuracy of the classifier depends on the function defined by
\(p(y|x;\theta) \). The distance between the parameters do not inform us
about distance between the two functions. Hence, we cannot draw any conclusions
about the difference in accuracy of the classifiers.

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remember that the natural gradient of a model is the Fisher information matrix of that model times the
vanilla gradient (<script type="math/tex">F^{-1}g</script>). How does CG allow us to approximate the natural gradient?
    <ol>
      <li>What is the naive way to compute <script type="math/tex">F^{-1}g</script>? How much memory and time would it take?
        <details><summary>Solution</summary>
Assume we have an estimate of \(F\) (by the process
in section 7 of <a href="/assets/k-fac-tutorial.pdf">Matt Johnson's tutorial</a>).
Storing \(F\) would take space proportional to \(n^2\), and inverting \(F\) would take
time proportional to \(n^3\) (or slightly lower with the Strassen algorithm)
</details>
      </li>
      <li>How long would a run of CG to <em>exactly</em> compute <script type="math/tex">F^{-1}g</script> take? How does that compare
to the naive process?
        <details><summary>Solution</summary>
Each iteration of CG computes \(Fv\) for some vector \(v\), which would take time
proportional to \(n^2\). CG converges to the true answer after \(n\) steps, so in total
it would take time proportional to \(n^3\). This process ends up being slower than directly inverting
the Fisher naively and uses the same amount of memory.
